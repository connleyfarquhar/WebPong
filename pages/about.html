        <h1>✨ Web Pong! Project ✨</h1>
        <p>
            In my free time, when not working on other projects, I decided to develop a simple Pong game that functions purely in the web browser. 
            While similar projects exist, this one will be a fun pastime for me as it's something I haven't ventured into before.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Pong game in theory will be the simple Pong that we all know and have seen before. In future, if the project is a success, I may attempt to add my own swing to the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if the project is successful or not, it remains an interesting alternative project to have worked on and will be publicly accessible on my GitHub Page.
        </p>
